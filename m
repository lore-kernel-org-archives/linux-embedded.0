I guess Kernel-driven overlay application (it's been called "quirks"
elsewhere) would fall under this? It's rather scary, and would need
fairly strict rules to be feasible and remain maintainable, which is
going to limit where it can be used.

I think the core guys for that are on the list already?

If people are going to package a kernel and DTB together, it would be
nice if they could at least be easily decomposed (using something like
FIT).

So +1 for that discussion.

I'm interested.

If the DT track goes ahead, I'll be there.
