devicetree-discuss@ozlabs.org mailing list is your friend here.  In
PowerPC land we've mostly settled on the policy of not merging a
driver before the device tree binding is documented, posted and
reviewed.  This weeds out a lot of common mistakes.

I also think the stuff in Documentation/powerpc/dts-bindings needs to
be moved out to a common location.
