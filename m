The problem is that with -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections gcc
will create sections like .text.head and .data.nosave
whenever someone will have innocuous code like this:

static void head(...) {...}

or this:

int f(...)
{ 
	static int nosave;
...
}

somewhere in the kernel.

Then kernel linker script will be confused and put these sections
in wrong places.

IOW: names like .text.XXXX and .data.XXX must not be used for "magic"
sections.

It's definitely (c). Changes in, say, include/linux/init.h:

-#define __nosavedata __section(.data.nosave)
+#define __nosavedata __section(.nosave.data)

must be syncronized with, say, arch/arm/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S:

                . = ALIGN(4096);
                __nosave_begin = .;
-               *(.data.nosave)
+               *(.nosave.data)

See above. Is that explanation ok?

Last time is was probably me :) about a year ago I think.
Last link stage takes niticeably more time, but
nothing really awful.

Yes, I was posting it twice during last year.
(digging up old emails from "sent" folder...) here is some:
