A couple of times I've suggested that we have the ability to allocate
one zone per address bit, so a 32-bit machine with 4k pages would end
up having 20 zones.  Then, your funny DMA mask can be directly passed
into the page allocator as a zone mask and voila, I think.

I wasn't even aware that there was an issue here.  Please don't blame
"mainline folk" for something they weren't told about!
