OK, if that's what you all want, that's what we can do ... however, it
would likely be the same people discussing the same issues.

This is what made us suggest the presentation driven approach.  We can
send people who understand how the kernel development process out
anointed as embedded maintainers.  However, looking at the arch
directory, you have a ton of new kids on the block.  We wondered if,
perhaps, rather than having seasoned kernel developers reach out to the
embedded community, we might try giving the embedded community the
opportunity to reach out to us.  The topic of "flattened device tree"
look interesting to me (perhaps because I'm a hardened device driver
person and things like that always look interesting to me) ... if we can
get a few more like that out of the woodwork, this approach might end up
being successful.
