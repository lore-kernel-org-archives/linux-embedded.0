I don't disagree that we may need DT binding here, but DT bindings are
h/w description and not a mechanism bind Linux kernel drivers. It can
be a subtle distinction, but it is an important one.

I can see the case where we have no driver. For RAM we don't have a
driver, yet pretty much all hardware has a DRAM controller which we
just rely on the firmware to setup. I could also envision that we have
hardware we do need to configure in the kernel. Perhaps the boot
settings are not optimal or we want/need to manage the clocks. That
seems somewhat unlikely if the kernel is also XIP from the same flash
as it is in Nico's case.

We do often describe the flash layout in DT when partitions are not
discoverable. I don't know if that would be needed here. Would the ROM
here ever be updateable from within Linux? If we're talking about a
single address to pass the kernel, DT seems like an overkill and
kernel cmdline is perfectly valid IMO.
