Yeah - I found that out by experimentation yesterday.  So my whole
idea for configuring it based on an unset CC was misguided.

Agreed. I'd like to separate this issue from the rest of the patch.
Shuah has accepted the patch as it currently is, but I'd like
to start working on the best way to support cross compilation
throughout the kselftest suite.

Ideally we can have CC set properly in a higher-level Makefile,
and not reference CROSS_COMPILE at all in the sub-directory Makefiles.
This may involve copying how CROSS_COMPILE and CFLAGS work in
the rest of the kernel tree, or making some kselftest-specific
modifications.
