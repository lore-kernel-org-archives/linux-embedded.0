You didn't describe the problem which you're trying to solve, so how
can I say?

Possibilities are:

a) the generic bit depends on the arch bits

   -> No probs.  I can merge the generic bit once all architectures are in.

b) the arch bits depend on the generic bits

   -> No probs.  I can merge the generic bit then send all the arch bits.

c) they each depend on each other

   -> No probs.  We go round gaththering acks, slam it all into
      a single patch then in it goes.  2.6.28, presumably.

d) something else

   -> please do tell.

(tries to work out what it does)

oh, it does the above section renaming.  So I guess we're looking at
scenario c), above?

"otherwise section placement done by kernel's custom linker scripts
produces broken vmlinux and vdso images" is an inadequate description. 
Please describe the problem more completely.  This is important,
because once we actually find out what the patch is fixing, perhaps
others will be aware of less intrusive ways of fixing the problem, and
we end up with a better patch.


Please be aware that last time someone tried function-sections, maybe
five years ago, problems were encountered with linker efficiency
(possible an O(nsections) or worse algorithm in ld).  Link times went
up a lot.

So it would be good to hunt down some old ld versions and run some
timings.  A mention of the results in the changelog is appropriate.


Is there actually a patch anywhere which enables function-sections for
some architectures?  It would be good to see that (and its associated
size-reduction results) so we can work out whether all these changes
are worth pursuing.

um, this would be a good occasion for us to have another attempt at
spelling "references".
