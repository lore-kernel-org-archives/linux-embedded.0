The objection I heard to that one is that the zone machinery works
better with fewer zones ... but we could certainly align them along
known boundaries for allocations (if it's only bit X that's the problem,
say, you only need an additional zone covering that one).

Based on this, I dug up the initial proposal, it was the Ottawa Kernel
Summit in 2005 (I'm a packrat; I keep all my old presentations):

kmalloc_mask() is right at the end.  It basically died for lack of
interest and the fact that GFP_DMA32 satisfied 99% of the actual use
cases.
