I experimented a bit with having some infrastructure for waiting for
another device to get either registered as part of the phylib stuff I
was doing.  Here's the patchwork link to the discussion:

http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/24152/

I never actually pushed through and finished it because it turned out
to be a non-issue for Ethernet devices in the end.  However, I can see
the value.  With this approach, a driver can use a
bus_register_notifier() variant without caring about the device
registration order, and the drivers notifier callback will get called
at the appropriate time.

In your example case I could see the framebuffer driver deferring the
final part of its initialization until the needed i2c device shows up.
