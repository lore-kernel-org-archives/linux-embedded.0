It is my understanding that such a hash table would be sparsely 
populated, so space would have to be reserved for the empty buckets. 
The current patch, which works in-place on the fully linked vmlinux, 
doesn't have to worry about finding enough space for the table.

If we were to do the collisionless hash, we would somehow have to 
reserve space for the empty buckets.

On my test kernel, there were only 1453 entries in the exception table, 
So doing the binary search takes a maximum of 11 loads.

So, I guess I am not strongly opposed to using a collisionless hash, but 
I think it may not be worth the extra effort.
