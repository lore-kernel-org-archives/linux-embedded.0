There are embedded systems were the firmware does not provide a usuable
memory map or where that is plain broken.  Or Linux with some extra init
code serves as the firmware.  Often there is a single serial EEPROM for
the entire system.  If there is an atrocity that can save a penny it will
be commited at least in the embedded world.
