Look at the early platform device abstraction, this allows specific
fine-grained control over when certain drivers are initialized, well
before the driver core is available. On SH this is how we deal with 
our system timers as clockevents/clocksources while just using regular
platform devices, and having no other abstraction. You can read more in
Documentation/driver-model/platform.txt.  For an example,  you can grep
for earlytimer in arch/sh as well as in drivers/clocksource.
