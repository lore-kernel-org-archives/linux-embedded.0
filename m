Dear (Embedded)-Kernel-Devs,

I'm trying to build linux 2.6.34.1 for a AT91RM9200 target. The whole
build process is successful because I get correct kernel images and
also a uImage for U-boot.
The U-boot version is 2010.08. I have build the whole system on a
64bit ubuntu machine. I use the latest buildroot to make the toolchain
and etc. At this moment I have a
openocd jtag dongle connected to my target for debug sessions.
I have check that the machine id/type are correct. I have gotten those
error messages of a unsupported target. I have resolved those errors.
The target is self is a AT91RM9200 with 64MiB ram and 16MiB cfi flash.
The boot args of u-boot are "console=ttyS0,115200n8
root=/dev/mtdblock0 rootfstype=jffs2 mem=64M".

The problem is now when linux kernel is booting, nothing happens.

Here is stalls. With my jtag probe I can locate the problem.

This just loops at that address. Why does it that?
You see that the mmu is enabled and the cpu has remapped the memory.
Does someone have a clue what goes wrong?

Here is the .config and board file.
