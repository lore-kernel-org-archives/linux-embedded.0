example: device configuration information stored in i2c eeprom (i.e.
dimensions of attached framebuffer), but i2c is not available when
framebuffer layer is setup.  framebuffer driver has to be built as a
module and loaded by userspace, or i2c information is read by
bootloader and passed down to the kernel.
