I absolutely agree with this. We have been using the flattened device t=
ree
on our MIPS platform to support multiple systems, and are close to post=
ing
a patch to the MIPS Linux mailing list. At least one other MIPS platfor=
m
has indicated that they want to use the device tree.

Is there another possibility besides the device tree that people are us=
ing
on 4 different architectures? We can't mandate support of the device tr=
ee
for any particular architecture or platform, but we can make sure the d=
evice
tree infrastructure is supported well enough that any architecture can =
pick
it up easily. Doing so will also encourage support in bootloaders which=
 may
not currently do so.

Should we decide to go this way, there probably a next step wherein we
standardize the device tree entries for those devices that are shared a=
cross
multiple architectures and platorms. This will likely be a never-ending
and mostly thankless task, but will again make things easier in the lon=
g run.
