Ish; essentially it's pushing the description of the non-enumerable bits
of the hardware out of kernel code and into a separate bit of data that
can be passed in to the kernel.

One issue that does have wider impact is that the OpenFirmware bindings
can affect any driver level code - it means that drivers may need to
parse configuration out of the device tree as well as the mechanisms
they normally use.  This is already happening due to the current use but
will become more visible if more platforms adopt the device tree.  As
someone primarily working on driver/subsystem side stuff this is my
primary concern with expanded use of device tree - it's another set of
platform data code that needs writing in addition to the other schemes
currently in use.

On the other hand, if all the embedded architectures got together and
agreeded to move in this direction it'd be pretty much equivalent to
some new BIOS standard being introduced for PCs so perhaps not worth
worrying about at a general kernel level.

Well, you could potentially try to render other BIOS data tables into
device tree format.  I'm not sure that the translation would be less
effort than parsing the existing data, though.
