To be fully general, we'd need to have some kind of proxy GPIO object
that always exists on the main board, for the plugin boards to provide
GPIOs to, or consume GPIOs from.

The simple case of a GPIO provider being on the main board and the
consumer being on a plugin board doesn't need this. The case of the GPIO
provider being on a plugin board, and the only GPIO consumer being on
the main board might not need this.

But if the GPIO provider is on one plugin board, and the GPIO consumer
on another, we'd want to have the DT chunks for each plugin board be
completely independent, so you'd need to route everything through
something that always exists, in the motherboard's DT. I haven't really
thought how that would look yet.

I think this is probably true irrespective of whether the bootloader is
merging the DT chunks, or the kernel did it during boot, or any other
way of constructing the final complete DT.
