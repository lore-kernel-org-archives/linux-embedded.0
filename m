So this is partially what the dma_sync_for_{device|cpu} is supposed to
be helping with.  By and large, the DMA API tries to hide the
complexities of coherency domains from the user.  The actual API, as far
as it goes, seems to do this OK.  We have synchronisation issues that
mmiowb() and friends help with ... what's the actual problem here?

So ZONE_DMA and coherent memory allocation as represented by the
coherent mask are really totally separate things.  The idea of ZONE_DMA
was really that if you had an ISA device, allocations from ZONE_DMA
would be able to access the allocated memory without bouncing.  Since
ISA is really going away, this definition has been hijacked.  If your
problem is just that you need memory allocated on a certain physical
mask and neither GFP_DMA or GFP_DMA32 cut it for you, then we could
revisit the kmalloc_mask() proposal again ... but the consensus last
time was that no-one really had a compelling use case that couldn't be
covered by GFP_DMA32.

flush_dcache_page() is supposed to be for making the data visible to the
user ... that coherency is supposed to be managed by the block layer.
The DMA API is specifically aimed at device to kernel space
coherency ... although if you line up all your aliases, that can also be
device to userspace.  Technically though we have two separate APIs for
user<->kernel coherency and device<->kernel coherency.  What's the path
you're seeing this problem down?  SG_IO to a device doing PIO should be
handling this correctly.

We have ioreadXbe for this exact case (similar problem on parisc)

This actually just works(tm) for me on a voyager system running SMP with
a mixed 486/586 set of processors ... what's the problem?  The only
issue I see is that you have to set the capabilities of the boot CPU to
the intersection of the mixture otherwise setup goes wrong, but
otherwise it seems to work OK.
