I'm not aware of such a discussion; I keep running into issues here.  In
fact, on ARM the DMA mask is exactly that - it's a 100% proper mask.  It's
not a bunch of zeros in the MSB followed by a bunch of ones down to the
LSB.  It can be a bunch of ones, a bunch of zeros, followed by a bunch of
ones.

The way we occasionally have to deal with this is to trial an allocation,
see if the physical address fits, if not free the page and try again with
GFP_DMA set.

We do certain checks on the DMA mask - notably that a GFP_DMA allocation
will satisfy the mask which has been passed.

I've never submitted the patch which does this in the ARM coherent DMA
allocator, but it's something that occasionally crops up as being
necessary - I've always thought the allocate-by-mask stuff would
eventually be merged.

There's many stories I've heard on what is supposed to take care of the
coherency that I now just close my ears to the problem and chant "it
doesn't exist, people aren't seeing it, mainline folk just don't give
a damn".  Really.  It is a problem on _some_ ARM devices and has been
for several years now, and I've 100% given up caring about it.

So people who see the problem just have to suffer with it, and they have
to accept that the Linux kernel sucks with PIO on ARM hardware.

Unless they use a driver I've written which has the necessary callbacks
in it to ensure cache coherency (like MMC).  IDE... forget it.

Yes, that taste you're experiencing is my bitterness on this subject.
