I suggested something like this several years ago to Anthony Liguori
who didn't much like it.  However qemu has changed a fair bit since
then, so it might be worth revisiting.

It's a big job though - lots of integration work with qemu's
configuration core.  In particular allowing this without breaking
migrations or the various qapis is not straightforward.

I havea presentation proposal for KVM Forum covering some ideas which
could be at least first steps towards doing this.
