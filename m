David Delaney has a proof-of-concept of an idea of his which was
presented at the last CELF, which is basically to put the kernel and
loadable kernel modules closely enough together that you can avoid the
use of long jumps. He sees a better than 1% improvement in performance,
which we've duplicated using a slightly different approach. This is nice
payback for little work and, though it doesn't help on all processors,
it helps on several.

The problem is: how do you allocate memory with the magical "close to
the kernel" attribute? We have something that adds a new ZONE_KERNEL
(this name has some problems, actually). It seems like a pretty good
solution if you look at zones as conceptually concentric usages, but
with the current zone implementation, each zone must be contiguous. So,
if we're talking about changing what zones are done, I'd like to throw
this into the pot.
