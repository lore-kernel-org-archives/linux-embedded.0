As this is about addresses of text, I imagine that you really care about the
virtual address the module is loaded at which is what the virtual address
space is responsible for and not the physical addresses which zones are
concerned with. Would that be right?

If that was the case, this could be potentially be done by moving where
the vmalloc address space is located or possibly splitting it in two. By
locating some portion of the vmalloc address space above the kernel
image, the kernel modules could be loaded in there.

It's different for the DMA problem, it really requires particular physical
addresses. No one trying to implementat Andrew's suggestion is a bit of a
surprise because basically, it'd do the job as far as I can see but is not
an issue that hurts me so I never sat down to try implementing it. Granted,
increasing the number of zones adds its own problem but it's for large numbers
of zones and there are other things that could be done to the allocator to
reduce its cache footprint. The big plus is that it plays very well with
reclaim and I would expect it to perform better than than searching the
free lists for a suitable page which would be a bit of a hatchet job.
