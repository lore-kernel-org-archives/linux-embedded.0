OK, so my minimal understanding in this area lead me to believe this was
because most embedded systems didn't have properly discoverable busses
and therefore you had to tailor the kernel configuration exactly to the
devices the system had.

It sounds interesting ... however, it also sounds like an area which
might not impact the core kernel much ... or am I wrong about that?  The
topics we're really looking for the Kernel Summit are ones that require
cross system input and which can't simply be sorted out by organising an
Embedded mini-summit.

Now if flattened device tree could help us out with BIOS, ACPI, EFI and
the other myriad boot and identification standards that seem designed to
hide system information rather than reveal it, then we might be all
ears ...
