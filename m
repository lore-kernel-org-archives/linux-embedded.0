The recent oftree activities look indeed very promising; the different
boot-information-passing methods, mainly in powerpc and arm land, is
IMHO and important field where a generic kernel infrastructure would
make sense for the embedded people. Taken that oftree has created
robustness and compatiblity problems in the past but seems to move into
a good direction recently, feedback from core kernel developers would
certainly be a good thing.

Could flickerfree-bootsplash be a topic? Or is that completely pushed
into the userspace these fastboot days?
