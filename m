I believe that's true for all/many NVIDIA boards too.

But, duplicating all this in every bootloader might not make sense.
Sure there are some cases where the bootloader needs this information
(e.g. to load the kernel from an SD card that's on 1 of N plugin
boards), but there may be much information the bootloader doesn't care
about.

Would it make sense to write a DT-identifying-and-merging shim that
can be executed by the bootloader, create the final DT, and then jump
to the kernel?

Hmmm. That's probably a bad idea, since then it means needing e.g. I2C
drivers to read the ID EEPROMs, pinmux drivers, ... in the shim.

Perhaps the common shim idea makes sense, but we need a standardized
API it can use that all bootloaders provide for it to operate.

This is beginning to sound a lot like a UEFI byte code module (I
assume; I know little about them)
