Hi Mark,

Thanks for getting the discussion started. I've seen the same issue come
up for arch/arm/mach-ux500/board-mop500*uib.c and for the beaglebone.
I'm sure there are many more, but we should make sure that everyone
of these can live with whatever we come up with.

One idea that I've heard before is to put device tree fragments into the
kernel and dynamically add them to the device tree that was passed by the
boot loader whenever we detect the presence of a specific device.
This obviously means it works only for boards using DT for booting, but
it allows us to use some infrastructure that we already have.

Another idea was to put all the possible extensions into the device tree
for a given board and disable them by default, putting it into the
responsibility of the boot loader to enable the one that is actually
being used. This has serious scalibility problems when there are many
possible extensions and also relies more on the boot loader than I would
like.

An intermediate solution that I really like is the ability to
stuff device tree fragments on extension board themselves, but that
can only work for new designs and causes problems when that information
is not actually correct.
