Yes, you are right, so we can fix it by the two ways below:

	-keep disable_irq in ret_slow_syscall, also add a extra 
	trace_ret_hardirqs_on before resume userspace.
or 
	-replace disable_irq with disable_irq_notrace in ret_slow_syscall
	and ret_fast_syscall, also add a extra trace_ret_hardirqs_off if
	there are works pending

seems the 2nd way is more efficient.

Yes, the patch still tries to remove the pointless trace of IRQ masking,
such as: replace disable_irq with disable_irq_notrace.

Even it is pointless, but if lockdep doesn't see the IRQ unmasking, the 
warning "unannotated irqs-on" will be triggered and lockdep doe not work
any longer, so we have to remove the warning to make lockdep workable on
ARM, could you agree on it?  It is the main purpose of the patch.

The warning was reported before and still exists in 2.6.34 and -next tree:
