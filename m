A board I have sitting on my desk right now has separate boards for (and
multiple options for each of):

* Motherboard
* CPU+DRAM
* PMU/PMIC
* Display (LCD)
... and many more.

Interaction with the PMU/PMIC is required for at least some of the boot
media options.

Interaction with the display (LCD) while not technically required to
simply boot the kernel is required by desired use-cases, in order to
display a splash screen ASAP during early boot.

Oh, and the motherboard has a gazillion different HW mux options, which
affect, amongst many other things, which SD/eMMC/SDIO ports are usable
on the motherboard, and which are routed to various daughter boards. I'm
not actually 100% sure if the switches controlling those mux settings
are readable from SW. I certainly hope so...
