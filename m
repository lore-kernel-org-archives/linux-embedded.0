Sorry to only chime in at v5.

I think the following is preferable:

  CC := $(CROSS_COMPILE)$(CC)


It allows optionally setting a custom CC, as well as optionally CROSS_COMPILE.

The only thing it doesn't do is choose gcc explicitly, but you shouldn't really
do that anyway - unless you absolutely require gcc. Let the user choose their
compiler by choosing where cc points.

cheers
