Hi Thomas,

Thanks a lot for the thorough review. I was preparing v6 when it came
in; I will hold it back and work all of this in first. Answers below.

Will do.

Sorry, I should have answered this the first time rather than keep
the parameter without a word. Let me explain why I would like to keep
the command line, for the colour and also for the parameters patch 12
adds, and you tell me whether it holds.

The build-time defaults cover what a product normally shows. The
parameters are for what is only known at boot: the bootloader finds an
update pending, a failed boot count or a recovery request, or reads the
product variant from an EEPROM, and wants the splash to say so, with
another logo or a red or amber background. Any bootloader can do that
by adding to the command line: a setenv in a U-Boot script, a recovery
entry in GRUB or systemd-boot. Changing the device tree instead needs
fdt support in the bootloader and knowledge of the node, and is not
possible at all when the device tree is signed along with the kernel
in a FIT image. On x86 with the BGRT there is no device tree, and the
command line is the only way.

There is precedent for this kind of setting: video=...,rotate=,
fbcon=rotate: and fbcon=logo-pos: are all about how the boot screen
looks, and console= wins over stdout-path the way these win over the
device tree.

So my proposal for v6: the defaults are set at build time, as you ask
(the colour already is, and the BMP's file name becomes a Kconfig
string), and the parameters stay, only to override them for one boot.
If that is still a no, I will drop them all, patch 12 included.

> file in the initfs, which we have to know about?

It is requested with request_firmware_nowait(), so it is looked up like
any other firmware: built into the kernel with EXTRA_FIRMWARE, in the
initramfs, or under /lib/firmware once the root file system is there.
The name is fixed by whoever builds the image, so

a Kconfig string fits it well for the default name; v6 will have it.
splash_bmp= would then only pick another file for one boot, such as
one of several images built in with EXTRA_FIRMWARE, as above.

>> +} __packed;

Yes, I'll add a patch that moves them there and makes efifb use the
header. The header keeps the __le types, as BMP is little endian
whatever the CPU, so efifb will read the fields through
get_unaligned_le*() like the splash does; no change on the little
endian systems EFI runs on. That patch touches fbdev, so it will go to
Helge and Peter as well.

The only release_firmware() on splash->fw is in
drm_splash_image_cleanup(), which runs in the render thread itself
once it has drawn, and at unregister after the thread has been
stopped. The firmware callback stores the firmware under fw_lock, or
releases it itself if the thread is already done, and never touches it
again. So nobody can release it while the thread reads from it; the
lock is only there for the hand-over from the callback. I'll put that
in a comment, since it is not obvious from the code.

OK, here and in the other places you pointed out.

OK.

OK.

Agreed. It also read one byte past the end of the image on the last
pixel. v6 already reads each pixel with get_unaligned_le24(), which
builds it from the three bytes, in this patch rather than in a later
one as in v5.

[...]

> That's the answer to my question above, i guess?   But what about bmp_width?

Yes. Both are signed in the BMP header, as in efifb's struct
bmp_dib_header. A negative width has no meaning, and keeping it signed
lets the format check reject it as such (bmp_width <= 0) rather than
see a huge width that only the size checks further down would stop.
I can read the width as unsigned and check it against S32_MAX instead
if you prefer.

OK, thanks.

OK. Together with your comment on patch 9, the blit will become a
function from this patch on.

Right, today an output plugged in later stays dark, and a restore puts
back the modesets of the first hotplug. v6 will rebuild on every
hotplug, keeping the image around so that an output plugged in later
gets it too.

The thread mostly waits: for the BMP firmware and for the next
redraw. A work item queued from the hotplug and from the firmware
callback covers both, and makes the start and stop paths simpler,
which is where v3 had its use-after-frees. I'll move it to
system_power_efficient_wq.

Fair enough. The early return was there because committing modesets
that still had a mode but no framebuffer failed with -EINVAL and a
WARN. v6 already clears the mode of an output that gets no buffer;
I'll do the same when the buffers are freed, drop the early return,
and let the commit turn the outputs off.

OK.

OK.
