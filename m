Local bus probing probably imposes a lot of assumptions on a bus
designed to be as open as possible.  How are chip selects wired up?
What base addresses do devices respond to?  How do you know what the
device is?  What IRQ lines are used?  PCI solves this by exporting
configuration space which defines all of this, but PCI is considerably
more complex and not as fast as a CPU's local bus.  Similarly busses
like spi and i2c either have no probing protocol defined (spi), or
cannot always be reliably probed (i2c).

In short, the drawbacks are complexity on devices which cannot afford
the complexity.
