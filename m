Most of these are probably tired and old, but some possible topic suggestions:

1) Kernel binary bloat (again)

2) Encouraging upstream participation of "Embedded" distros

Things like Moblin and Android are getting a lot of press these days, but
embedded distros have been around for a while.  Are we getting good
participation from these vendors?  Is there something we could be doing to
encourage such participation?  Has CELF helped with this at all?  etc

3) Netbooks - the bridge between embedded and desktop?

Is the flourish of low cost netbooks, some pre-installed with Linux, having any
impact on how we review and develop general kernel code?

One of the problems I struggle with is coming up with embedded topics general
enough to be of interest to a broader set of both upstream kernel developers
and the embedded community.  Those that are general enough have either been
discussed quite a bit already, or are already on the list of topics.

Maybe I'm just not trying hard enough.
