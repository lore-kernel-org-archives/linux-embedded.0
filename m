Good to see the PC-centric comments are going away :-)

The following architectures do not source "kernel/power/Kconfig":

alpha
cris
h8300
Kconfig
m32r
m68k
m68knommu
microblaze
parisc
score
sparc
tile
um
xtensa

Which means that (for now) I don't have to care that CONFIG_PM becomes
unclearable. Other people may care, though...
