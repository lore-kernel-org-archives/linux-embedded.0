Hardware is simple to incompatible to allow the generation of a single
"one size fits all" image.  To list a few reasons from the MIPS world:

  o little vs. big endian
  o 32-bit vs. 64-bit
  o different system firmwares
  o processors and peripherals requiring creative workarounds which for
    code size or performance reasons want to limit to those systems
    suffering from the issue.
  o often claustrophobically small memory sizes.
  o exactly no communality across all systems except the processor
    architecture.
  o vendors coming up with their own instruction set enhancements not
    supported by any competitor and insisting on their use for the extra
    bit of performance and product differenciation.
  o many users have a long standing "roll your own" attitude.
  o peripherals that are even less probeable than ISA cards

"Flattened Device Tree" can tackle only a small part of this but its a
step.

Agreed.
