The dts half is here[1]. It is a kernel repository automatically
stripped of everything but dts files.

I'd like this too. The QEMU maintainers don't really agree. I think
the ARM virt platform is the wrong way around with QEMU generating the
DT. There was a patch series to allow sysbus devices to be created on
the command line like you can with PCI. This would have allowed a
front end script to generate a QEMU command line from a DT. I'm not
sure if it ever got in.

It would lower the bar to adding new platforms to just writing models
for blocks perhaps. I'm not sure there's enough interest. The number
of ARM platforms supported in QEMU is much less than the kernel.
