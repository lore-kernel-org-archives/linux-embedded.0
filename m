Well, OK.  I just don't want to lob bombs at NEC and then
have some poor soul over there get immediately rebuffed, due to
basic ARM churn.  Maybe not having naviengine support upstream
is my fault, but Sony doesn't make the CPU, so it doesn't seem
like it should be my job to mainline the chip support.  About
the only thing I have at my disposal is pressure not to buy
the chip (but this is harder to exercise than one might think.)
