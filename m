There are systems (and I bet it will be a growing number) where U-Boot
itself uses the DT for configuration.  Also, there are functions that
are needed both by the boot loader and the kernel - for example to
dislay a splash screen the boot loader needs to initialize the
display, so it must be able to detect which type of LCD is attached
(resolution, color-depth, orientation) - the device tree comes in very
handy here.  Why should Linux re-do all such things?

Best regards,

Wolfgang Denk
