Is there a device tree porting HOWTO anywhere? If I have a board
that's using explicit C initialization, and I want to convert it over
to device tree, step by step what do I do?

If I'm writing a new board support, what device tree bits do I need to
get a shell prompt on a serial port running out of initramfs?
(Physical memory, interrupt controller, timer to drive the scheduler,
serial chip...)

There's a bunch of device tree reference material out there, but no
tutorial material at all, that I can find...
