I2C or similar busses can be a particularly annoying if they contain
essential configuration information such as memory size which is needed
long before anything else.  So for far a common solution is that platfo=
rms
are carrying a private (aka redundant, ugly) early-i2c system that's ju=
st
about sufficient for this purpose.
