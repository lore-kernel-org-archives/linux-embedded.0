OK - that's hilarious.  Saying 'Oops!' would be too casual for my degree of
embarrassment. :-)

Makefiles do have similar constructs.  Those should have been
ifeq ($(CC),)
	...
endif

This obviously got through via a failiure in testing - which is somewhat ironic.

Look for a v6 soon.  (Geez, when is the merge window coming.  I thought this trivial
program would get in pretty easily, but no... that's never the way.  Of course
it helps if the submitter is not an idiot.)
