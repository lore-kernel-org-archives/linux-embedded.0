If your system is hooked up to a serial console, another helpful thing to 
do is to pass in "ftrace_dump_on_oops" in the command line and also keep 
the event tracer running, where you enable just the events you are 
interested in. Then if the system crashes, it will dump out the ftrace 
buffer to the console, which could be logged by a serial console and then 
you at least have a trace of the events that lead up to the crash.

The event tracer while active is not that much overhead and could be 
enabled in a production system.
