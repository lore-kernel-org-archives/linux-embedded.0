Agreed, and isn't really my position either.  I do understand that
some things, like different CPU cores requiring different code
generation options, will probably never be feasible to support in a
single image.  Others may be doable, but not worthwhile because of
memory constraints or impact on hot paths.

I've been working on the Xilinx Virtex platform which is a CPU core
surrounded by a big FPGA fabric.  Doesn't get much non-standardized
that that.  :-)  It is trivial to build an image which boots on all of
the ppc440 platforms; the SoCs, and the Virtex5 FPGA.

Most of the 60x based SoCs have been merged too; all with very
different bus architectures, interrupt controllers and embedded
devices, but I do grant you that it isn't the same level of diversity
as in ARM land.

However, there has been no attempt to make a single powerpc image
which boots on everything; the cores are too different.  Instead, we
break it up by CPU type: 40x, 44x, 60x, 64 bit and the 8xx stuff that
everyone tries to forget.  IIUC, in ARM the MMU architecture is quite
varied, and that would have significant impact too.

Within each sub arch pretty much anything goes.  The kernel
initializes itself to the point of setting up the MMU and then probes
the machine definitions (arch/powerpc/platforms/*) until it finds one
which matches the device tree data.  At that point it is able to
branch off and set up the correct interrupt controller, register
devices and configure busses, etc.  As long as the correct machine
definition is compiled in, then everything goes.

As I'm sure you're about to point out :-), PowerPC machine probing
really isn't all that different from ARM machine probing except that
ARM uses the machine number and PowerPC uses the "model" property in
the device tree.  The real difference is the source of data describing
which devices are present; it just happens to be in an external data
structure instead of compiled in.  A lot of what was originally
thought to be machine specific code has just gone away because the
device tree infrastructure handles it elegantly.  Only the parts that
truly are machine specific continue to hang around.

I'm *not* suggesting that all ARM machines, or even most ARM machines
should be reworked to use something like the device tree.  What I am
suggesting is that there are many uses cases where it does make sense.
 For example, on the range of ARM netbooks rumored to come out near
the end of the year, the prospect of having a single kernel image boot
on multiple netbooks from multiple vendors is attractive to
distribution vendors like Canonical.  Device Tree certainly isn't the
only way to do this, but it is a viable one.
