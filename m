For what it's worth, this is true for pretty much ALL systems with
removable memory modules, since Serial Presence Detect (SPD) is
electrically equivalent to I2C.

However, on most systems, even embedded, bringing up memory falls on
firmware (sometimes in the form of a boot loader) so Linux rarely sees it.
