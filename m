OMAP is doing pretty nasty things with their early serial port support.  
This is most likely to screw up XIP.

Just to be clear... We have XIP in the tree already.  If it is useful 
to someone, in-tree or out-of-tree, then it is worth keeping around.  
Even if the only user was out-of-tree which certainly wasn't the case 
when I added XIP support to the kernel, then ripping it out and adding 
it back later would be more trouble than preserving it.

What I was asking recently is whether or not XIP is still useful to 
someone today.  Apparently it is, which is the answer I was looking for.
